# Sequence-Alignment

A program that calculates the Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance) between two different strings. This distance has many applications, in which the one focused here will be on Bioinformatics with Sequence Alignment. 

Main purpose is to help me get used to the Julia Programming Language.
